# Ant Design Patterns - HOCs - v1.0.0

## When do you should use this solution?

If you want to control [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) React components you can save your time by use prepared patterns. You do not more need focus at React states and rerendering problems. You can just use prepared methods like for example `option()` to change Ant Design component's props and render that again.

## What is HOC idea?

A [higher-order component](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from React’s compositional nature.
